# Colsgen

Colsgen lets you generate AI-powered data for your CSV columns. Upload your file, add prompts, and let our tool handle the rest. All processing is done locally in your browser, ensuring privacy. Use your own API key for full control — no sign-up, no limits.


### How to Use Colsgen

1. **Upload Your File**
   Drag and drop your CSV file — we'll automatically detect the columns.

2. **Add Generative Columns**
   Define new columns where you want AI-generated content.

3. **Add Prompts**
   Write customized prompts using column placeholders (e.g., `{{column_name}}`).

4. **Hit "Generate" and Wait**
   Click the generate button, and let the AI fill your rows. It’s that easy!


### Model We Chose for the Prototype

We selected **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for the prototype because it is the most affordable option, allowing users to access it for free. The tool is designed to work with **your own API key**, giving users full control over the costs and usage while ensuring they can access a powerful AI model.

### Privacy

We don’t store your API key on our servers (in fact, we don’t even have a server). All operations, including API requests, run **locally in your browser**. Your data and API key remain private and are never sent to us.

### Monetize

We plan to monetize through a **pay-as-you-go** model. If user feedback is positive, we aim to integrate more powerful AI models and use our own API key to offer users even more advanced and powerful generative tools.
